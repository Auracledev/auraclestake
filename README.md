### 2. Helius Webhook
Already set up to:

- Monitor: `7NRCgd7Sr9JCnNF4HXPJ5CAvi5G6MCfkpJHyaD2HqEpP`
- Events: SOL transfers

### 3. Weekly Reward Pool
Update the `weekly_reward_pool` in the `platform_stats` table:
```sql
UPDATE platform_stats 
SET weekly_reward_pool = 10.0  -- Set your weekly SOL reward amount
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM platform_stats LIMIT 1);
```

## ðŸ“Š Reward Distribution Flow

1. **Admin triggers** "Calculate Rewards" button
2. **System calculates** each user's share:
   - User share = (User staked / Total staked)
   - User reward = User share Ã— Weekly pool
3. **Rewards added** to `pending_rewards` in database
4. **Users see** updated balance in real-time
5. **Users click** "Withdraw Rewards"
6. **SOL transferred** from vault to user wallet
7. **Transaction recorded** in database

## ðŸ”’ Security Features

- âœ… Vault private key stored securely in environment
